Vibe --- dev log

So far, I'm more or less equal in progress to the python libtcod tutorial, part 4.
I have done some basic map generation with walls and collision, FOV, and rendering with pygame.

DONE: implement A* pathfinding in entity.py for ai to use
DONE: add different sprites for dead entities
DONE: fix game map size relative to screen
TODO: add inventory menu
