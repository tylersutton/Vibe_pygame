Vibe --- dev log

So far, I'm more or less equal in progress to the python libtcod tutorial, part 4.
I have done some basic map generation with walls and collision, FOV, and rendering with pygame.

DONE: implement A* pathfinding in entity.py for ai to use
DONE: add different sprites for dead entities
DONE: fix game map size relative to screen
DONE: add inventory menu

I don't update this enough. Whoops.
I'm currently up to date making my own version of the python tcod tutorial, up to part 9.
I also have a camera that follows the player, and my menus are using pygame_gui instead of libtcod.
Not actually using libtcod at all in this project. I'm using pygame and pygame_gui for any graphics,
and I made my own implementations for A*, fov, etc.
